# DSCI525_group02
## Introduction

This project is a team project involving big data. We will build and deploy an ensemble machine learning model in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia on a large dataset, in order to forecast future daily rainfall amount in Australia. 

The rainfall data we used is around 6GB, which is collected from daily rainfall from year 1889 to year 2014 in New South Wales, Australia. This dataset is also hosted in [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681) and we leverage the `figshareAPI` to get the dataset.
## Objectives

There are four objectives for this project:

1.  [(Milestone 1)](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI525_group02/blob/main/notebooks/Milestone1.ipynb): Retrieve the data from website using figshareAPI and perform EDA in different data format (e.g. CSV, Parquet)

2. Milestone 2

3. Milestone 3

4. Milestone 4

## Dependencies

All the dependencies are listed in `group2.yml`.

To create and activate the environment, run the following commands in the command line from the root directory of this project:

``` shell
# create the virtual env
conda env create -f group2.yml
# activate the env
conda activate 525_2022_group2
```
